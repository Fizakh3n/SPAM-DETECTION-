SPAM DETECTION MODEL <br> 
In an age where email communication is a cornerstone of both personal and professional interactions, ensuring that our inboxes remain free from spam is essential. I recently completed a project focused on developing an efficient spam detection model that enhances email security and user experience.<br>

üîç Objective of the Model<br> 
The primary goal of this model is to accurately classify incoming emails as "spam" or "ham." By achieving high accuracy, we can protect users from unwanted distractions and potential phishing threats.<br> 

üîß Operations Involved<br> 
‚Ä¢Data Collection:<br> 
I gathered a diverse dataset of labeled emails, consisting of both spam and legitimate messages, which is crucial for effective training.<br> 

‚Ä¢Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):<br> 
Conducted EDA to understand data distributions, identify trends, and uncover insights that guided feature selection.<br> 

‚Ä¢Feature Extraction:<br> 
Used Count Vectorizer to convert the email text into numerical vectors, capturing the frequency of words in each email.<br> 

‚Ä¢Pipeline Implementation:<br> 
Built a pipeline that seamlessly integrates Count Vectorizer with Multinomial Naive Bayes, streamlining the preprocessing and classification steps for improved efficiency.<br> 

‚Ä¢Evaluation:<br> 
The model's performance was assessed using metrics like precision, recall, and F1-score to ensure its reliability in real-world applications.<br>
